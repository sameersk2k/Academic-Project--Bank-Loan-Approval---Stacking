# Academic-Project--Bank-Loan-Approval---Stacking
This project aims at creating a machine learning model that could predict whether a person is eligible of obtaining a personal loan or not.
The obtained model is then deployed as a web application using Fast - API.

We have used a Ensemble Learning called Stacking which is used to obtain a meta model trained from 4 base models for more accurate prediction without overfitting.
